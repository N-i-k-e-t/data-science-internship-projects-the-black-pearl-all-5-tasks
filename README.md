# DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP 5 PROJECTS OF THE BLACK PEARLS COMPANY
The Black Pearls Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects completed during my internship at The Black Pearls from June 15, 2024, to July 15, 2024. Each project addresses a different business problem using various techniques and algorithms.

Project Overview

The projects cover a range of machine learning tasks:

Classification:

Iris Flower Classification: This project built a K-Nearest Neighbors model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Spam Detection Model: This project implemented a spam detection model using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate).

Regression:

Unemployment Rate Prediction in India: This project analyzed unemployment trends in India and built predictive models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to forecast unemployment rates.

Car Price Prediction: This project developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features like year, mileage, and condition using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression algorithms.

Sales Prediction using Advertising Data: This project built a predictive model to forecast sales based on advertising spending across different media (TV, radio, newspaper) using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression, and XGBoost.

Skills Demonstrated

This internship provided the opportunity to develop the following skills:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data patterns and insights through visualization and statistical analysis.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.

Machine Learning Model Building (Classification & Regression): Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms.

Model Evaluation and Selection: Choosing the best model based on performance metrics.

Data Visualization: Communicating insights through clear and informative visualizations.

Python Programming: Proficiency in using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Business Relevance

The projects address real-world business challenges relevant to various industries, including:

E-commerce/Marketing: Sales prediction, customer segmentation, spam detection.

Automotive: Car price prediction, demand forecasting.

Human Resources/Workforce Planning: Unemployment rate prediction, skill gap analysis.

How to Run the Projects

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/black-pearls-internship.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd project-name

Install required libraries: Typically, each project will have a requirements.txt file. Install the libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the project script: Instructions for running the specific project will be in the project's README file.
