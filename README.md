This repository showcases a collection of data science and machine learning projects completed during my internship at The Black Pearls from June 15, 2024, to July 15, 2024. Each project tackles a distinct business problem using diverse techniques and algorithms.

## Project Overview

These projects delve into various machine learning tasks:

**Classification:**

* **Iris Flower Classification:** This project utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.
* **Spam Detection Model:** This project implements a spam detection model using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate).

**Regression:**

* **Unemployment Rate Prediction in India:** This project analyzes unemployment trends in India and builds predictive models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to forecast unemployment rates. 
* **Car Price Prediction:** This project develops a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features like year, mileage, and condition using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression algorithms.
* **Sales Prediction using Advertising Data:** This project builds a predictive model to forecast sales based on advertising spending across different media (TV, radio, newspaper) using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression, and XGBoost.
